abstract     = {<p>We propose a new method to quickly and accurately predict 3D positions of body
                joints from a single depth image, using no temporal information. We take an
                object recognition approach, designing an intermediate body parts representation
                that maps the difficult pose estimation problem into a simpler per-pixel
                classification problem. Our large and highly varied training dataset allows the
                classifier to estimate body parts invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, etc.
                Finally we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by
                reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes.
The system runs
                at 200 frames per second on consumer hardware. Our evaluation shows high accuracy
                on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several
                training parameters. We achieve state of the art accuracy in our comparison with
                related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton
                nearest neighbor matching.</p>},
